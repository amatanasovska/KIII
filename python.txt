Title: The Python Song

In the land of code, a sly one lurks,
Whose power is vast, and skills unmatched,
A language of might, with syntax so neat,
Python, the beast, the king of the streak.

Its syntax so short, yet oh so grand,
A language of wonder, at your command,
With libraries galore, and frameworks so fine,
Python, the gem, that shines divine.

In the realm of AI, it reigns supreme,
With TensorFlow and scikit-learn, the dream,
Data analysis and machine learning, a breeze,
Python, the master, that never ceases.

Its community so strong, so vast and so wise,
A world of knowledge, with open eyes,
With GitHub and Stack Overflow, at hand,
Python, the gift, that's always grand.

So let us sing, this wondrous tale,
Of Python, the language, so hale,
That brings us joy, and never fails,
Python, the treasure, that never wails.
