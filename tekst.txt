Title: The GitHub Song

Oh GitHub, a world of code so fine,
A platform for developers, all in line.
With pull requests and branches so grand,
Your codebase is always in demand.

Your issues are like a puzzle so bright,
A challenge for coders to unite.
The solutions are like a work of art,
A masterpiece, a new start.

The forks and stars, they twinkle so bright,
A treasure trove of code, a delight.
The branches and merges, they flow so smooth,
A symphony of code, a gentle brook.

The pull requests, they come and go,
A never-ending flow, you know.
With each one, a chance to improve,
A chance to make the code more groove.

The code reviews, they're like a game,
A test of skill, a test of fame.
The approvals, they're like a prize,
A reward for the developer's eyes.

Oh GitHub, you're a wondrous sight,
A world of code, a world of might.
You bring us together, you make us strong,
A platform for coders, all day long.
